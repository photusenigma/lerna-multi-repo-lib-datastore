    A GraphQL lib.  Link to React developer docs (includes info about redux)

    A rather nice datastore framework supporting lean model definition by configuration, RESTful helpers, and levering identity maps for facilitating both ORM style relationships (has-one, belongs-to, has-many, etc.) and a rather impressive in-memory query syntax.  Integration adapters are available for many integrations (no GraphQL yet, but I expect one soon.)
